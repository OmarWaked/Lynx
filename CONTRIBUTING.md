## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Xcode 15.0+** (Latest stable version)
- **iOS 18.5+** deployment target
- **Firebase Account** for backend services
- **Git** for version control

### Local Development

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lynx.git
   cd lynx
   ```

2. **Set up Firebase**
   - Create a development Firebase project
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Replace the placeholder file

3. **Install dependencies**
   - Open `Lynx.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Build the project to resolve Swift Package Manager dependencies

4. **Run the app**
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

### Development Environment

- **SwiftLint**: Code style enforcement
- **SwiftFormat**: Code formatting
- **Firebase CLI**: Backend development tools

## üìù Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

- **Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines**
- **Use SwiftLint** for consistent code style
- **Prefer SwiftUI** over UIKit for new views
- **Use modern Swift features** (async/await, @MainActor)

### Naming Conventions

- **PascalCase** for types and protocols
- **camelCase** for variables and functions
- **Descriptive names** that explain purpose
- **Avoid abbreviations** unless widely understood

### Code Organization

- **Group related functionality** in extensions
- **Use MARK comments** for logical sections
- **Keep functions focused** and single-purpose
- **Limit file size** to reasonable limits

### Documentation

- **Document public APIs** with Swift documentation comments
- **Include examples** for complex functionality
- **Update README** for new features
- **Add inline comments** for complex logic

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- **Test business logic** in managers and models
- **Mock dependencies** for isolated testing
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Maintain high test coverage**

### UI Tests

- **Test critical user flows** and navigation
- **Verify UI state** changes correctly
- **Test accessibility** features
- **Use realistic test data**

### Integration Tests

- **Test Firebase operations** with test database
- **Verify data persistence** and retrieval
- **Test authentication flows** end-to-end
- **Clean up test data** after tests

### Test Structure

```swift
class CouponManagerTests: XCTestCase {
    var sut: CouponManager!
    var mockFirestore: MockFirestore!
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        mockFirestore = MockFirestore()
        sut = CouponManager(firestore: mockFirestore)
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        sut = nil
        mockFirestore = nil
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    func testFetchCoupons_Success() {
        // Given
        let expectedCoupons = [Coupon.mock]
        mockFirestore.mockResult = .success(expectedCoupons)
        
        // When
        let result = await sut.fetchCoupons()
        
        // Then
        XCTAssertEqual(result, expectedCoupons)
    }
}
```
